*** Test Cases ***

Verify Canoe Compile log exists
    [Documentation]    Check that there is a log from compile
    File Should Exist    ${CANoeCompileLog}

Check CANoe Config found
    [Documentation]    Check that compilation was able to find CANoe config file
    ${ret}=    Grep File    ${CANoeCompileLog}    CANoe Compile] Config found
	Should Not Be Empty    ${ret}
    Log To Console         ${ret}

Check Branch Mastership
    [Documentation]    Ensures that script was able to aquire mastership of branch
    ${ret}=    Grep File    ${CANoeCompileLog}    CANoe Compile] Mastership OK
	Should Not Be Empty    ${ret}
    Log To Console         ${ret}

Check CANoe Config Checkout
    [Documentation]    Compilation successfully checked out CANoe config
    ${ret}=    Grep File    ${CANoeCompileLog}    CANoe Compile] Check out OK
	Should Not Be Empty    ${ret}
    Log To Console         ${ret}

Check CANoe Compile Result
    [Documentation]    We have a successful compliation
    ${ret}=    Grep File    ${CANoeCompileLog}    CANoe Compile] Compile OK
	Should Not Be Empty    ${ret}
    Log To Console         ${ret}

Verify CANoe Compile Result
    [Documentation]    Was able to run the compliation
    ${ret}=    Grep File    ${CANoeCompileLog}    CANoe Compile] Measuement start None
	Should Not Be Empty    ${ret}
    Log To Console         ${ret}

Check Config Saved
    [Documentation]    Ensure that compiled file was saved
    ${ret}=    Grep File    ${CANoeCompileLog}    CANoe Compile] Store CANoe config
	Should Not Be Empty    ${ret}
	Log To Console         ${ret}

Check Successful Checkin
    [Documentation]    Check that CANoe Config is checked in
    ${ret}=    Grep File    ${CANoeCompileLog}    CANoe Compile] Sucessfully checked in new CANoe config
    Should Not Be Empty    ${ret}
    Log To Console         ${ret}

Verify That Config Not Left
    [Documentation]    Verify that CANoe Config is not left checked out
    ${ret}=    Grep File    ${CANoeCompileLog}    CANoe Compile] File left in checked out state 
    Run Keyword If         '${ret}' != '${Empty}'    Log To Console    Config left in checked out state, is "CHECK IN" is ticked?
    Run Keyword If         '${ret}' != '${Empty}'    Log To Console    ${ret}
    Should Be Empty        ${ret}
	
Check Measurement Restart
    [Documentation]    Check that it is possible to use the configuration
    ${ret}=    Grep File    ${CANoeCompileLog}    CANoe Compile] Measurement re-start returned None
    Should Not Be Empty    ${ret}
    Log To Console         ${ret}
